# Foodtrac

Foodtrac is a social networking app that makes food trucks more accessible to their fans. At the moment, there is no common solution for tracking down a food truck you like, or even knowing what truck might be parked around the corner. You might have to check a number of sources including Instagram, Facebook, Yelp, etc. Our app seeks to remedy the situation by providing a consolidated platform for this very purpose.

## Getting Started

1) `npm install || yarn` Install the necessary dependencies

2) `gulp db` Create and seed the database

3) `gulp` Runs nodemon, watches the seed data for seed data changes, and runs webpack with hot reload

4) Set your environment variables in `.env` reflecting the template we have provided in `.env.sample`. Open localhost on your preferred port in your desired browser to get started!

## Development environment

- VAPID Keys generated by running `require('web-push').generateVAPIDKeys()` in node

### You'll need these programs/services
